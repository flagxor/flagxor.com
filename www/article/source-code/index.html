Source code, while a common property of programming languages,
is by no mean universal. Languages like Smalltalk, traditional
interactive BASICs, and some Forths often have "source of truth"
representations other than text files. Additional REPLs of all sorts
often retain program state that exists only for the duration
of an interactive session. What are the trade-offs and why does text
continue to be the dominant format?
</p>

<hr/>
<p>
A key feature of early micro-computers was an integrated BASIC that contained
not only an interpreter, but an integrated editor. While a few micro-computer
BASICs stored raw program text, the majority stored your program as some
combination of text and pre-parsed tokens.
This was partially due to fact most of the early BASICs were descended from
or inspired by either
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC">Microsoft BASIC</a>.
But it was also likely the result of a desire to save memory on resource
constrained devices.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, this design choice had several added benefits.
Programs were often "automatically" reformatted to a consistent style,
as post-parsed results often eliminated things like extra whitespace,
or reintroduced it but with a consistent style.
Early refactoring tools, like line renumbering, were easier to implement
when programs were stored as an in memory linked list.
</p>
<p>
Smalltalk and Self apply an even more pure "sourceless" approach
in which classes or prototypes are primarily represented as in-memory
data structures. This has the advantage, and the drawback,
of program code being stored as a memory snapshot.
</p>
<p>
Some Forths have experimented in this direction. A few experimental
Forths are purely sourceless. But more often Forths have explored
using pre-parsed representations.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware">Open Firmware</a>
used a representation (FCode) in which each word was pre-parsed
into a number.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorForth">Color Forth</a>
stores each Forth word as a 32-bit Huffman encode, color tagged
value.
In both cases, however, a interpretation phase actually
compiles / interprets these formats and populates the runtime
Forth dictionary.
Nonetheless, most quality direct / indirect threaded Forths
implement a "SEE" word which
can effectively decompile / disassemble word definitions at runtime,
usually with a high degree of reliability.
</p>
<p>
In my own Forth explorations, I've often struggled with the tension
between the value of source code and the value of having Forth's
runtime state be the source of truth.
Falling back to source code, be it plain text, or a pre-parsed
format has the advantage of preserving the bootstrapping process
in a changeable form. Image based systems, as is typical of Smalltalk
have the odd property that the lineage of a system is often embedded
in the whole system snapshot. Bootstrapping a new variant
involves starting with an existing Smalltalk
image and evolving it to a new desired state.
Just as I try to avoid carrying with me a complex .vimrc file,
I chafe at the idea of my programming environment being
a weathered thing carrying its baggage along.
This seems to run very much counter to the idea of starting something new.
</p>
<p>
Pre-parsed representations have the appeal of making some kinds
of automatic refactoring easier to perform in software robustly.
But the danger is that one needs at least basic
tooling to create such a representation when bootstrapping
or migrating.
When
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BASIC">BASICA</a>
transitioned to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GWBasic</a>
their shared token format meant things went smoothly.
However, the transition to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>,
which abandoned tokenized source files in favor of plain text,
was a jarring transition. A copy of the old interpreter
was required, so that you could export to plain text.
The new interpreter simply did not support the old format.
</p>
<p>
A related issue with Forth is the question of source code files vs
source code blocks. More bare to the metal Forths, particularly ones
that run without an operating system are known to use 1KB data blocks
displayed in a 64x16 area as the atomic unit of source code.
This has many nice properties: a file system is not required,
line and screen editors are dramatically easier to implement,
and the artistic constraint of a fixed size page makes for very
readable, consistent, and succinct program text.
Tooling for editing or conversion is usually easy to construct.
The drawback is that the format is non-standard,
and potentially wasteful. Also, while all block programs can be
converted losslessly to files, the reverse is not true (at least not trivially).
</p>
<p>
A common practice with block editors is the use of so-called shadow
blocks. Blocks are handled as a pair, one for source code, the other for
comments. The two are either displayed side by side, or a toggle button
shifts from one to the other.
This has the advantage of allowing free form comments in the shadow block.
Also printouts of source code have the nice property that the source
and shadow blocks, at a reasonable font size, can sit side by side in a listing.
The approach is likely also popular because a 64x16 region is
a fairly tight space when comments are inline.
I personally find shadow blocks unpleasant, but that seems to be
a minority view.
</p>
<p>
I am frequently tempted to devise my own text editor.
For my various experimental Forths, I've implemented reasonably
decent block editors, usually in 4-10 blocks of code.
A general text editor is obviously more daunting.
What usually stops me from commencing in earnest is that contrast.
A block editor, being surprisingly easy to implement to a level of
quality that would make it pleasant enough to use daily,
seems like the right idea. Unfortunately, relatively little of my
day to day text processing is with blocks.
</p>
<p>
I'm occasionally tempted to impose a block editing style on file editing.
I imagine some interchange between the two might be possible,
cleverly marking line continuations in some machine decodable style.
Most source code I deal with is 80 column. An 80x25 sized block might
help make this work.
</p>
<p>
Forth is dangerously close to being a language that could be
sourceless. It's dictionary, particularly in simpler threaded Forths,
is very close to isomorphic with the source code.
In my mind there are two main issues with going there.
First, often Forth takes advantage of redefining words so that they
mean different things in different contexts. I certainly have done this
in my programs. But usually I feel like something is wrong when I do it.
The other problem is the dictionary format itself.
While most Forth dictionaries are fairly similar,
I've never really been happy with them.
As Chuck Moore pointed out in a quote in
<a href="http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/">Thinking Forth</a>,
the Forth dictionary is often the most complicated data structure
in a Forth system. That complexity, at least in a Forth context,
feels wrong.
</p>
<p>
The potential advantages of a sourceless Forth are tempting, however.
"Good" Forth programs consist of lots of 1-2 line definitions.
It's tempting to think that seeing the context of a given definition
(in the sense of showing the definitions of the words used to define
it and the words that use it), would be nice.
However, the experience with blocks in particular, suggests this might
not pan out. Part of the asthetic appeal of blocks is that they can
be formatted in two dimensions, without consideration of carriage returns.
It's unlikely that automatic methods will have quite the same flare,
regardless of how cleverly contextual they are.
Auto-complete is nice when searching, but likely not when reading code.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">
Literate Programming</a> would also seem to suggest that limiting the location
of definitions based on use doesn't fit the narrative style of the human
mind. It's hard to say with certainty without trying it.
</p>
<p>
All of this seems to suggest that source code is here to stay.
Relatively little has crept in beyond ASCII.
Remarkably, we did get beyond programming languages
printable with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter">Selectric</a>
typeball font.
Though the continued precence of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs">Trigraphs</a>
in C++ would seem to contradict this to some degree.
I wish for more in my source format at times (particularly color
or perhaps limited font control), but just as often I wish for less
in the form of blocks.
I think I should console myself with the fact we've somehow managed
to stick with a minimalistic format like text for source code.
So few things in software are minimal these days after all.
