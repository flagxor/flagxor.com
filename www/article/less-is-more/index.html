<h1>less is more</h1>
<h2>June 20, 2011</h2>

<p>
A number of recently added standard Forth words have been dropped
from the core vocabulary:
<pre>! @ IF ELSE THEN VARIABLE ALLOT HERE.</pre>
Surprisingly few haikus had to be updated to accommodate,
suggesting not much has been lost.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
I recently added a number of standard Forth words to the Haiku Forth
core word list. Theoretically these words might have allowed interesting
behavior. In practice, only 4 haikus (two of which were derived works)
required updating. In both cases, the result was smaller.
</p>
<p>
The exclusive user of IF, THEN were the two mandelbrot
haikus.
They each contained the sequence:
<pre>dup 0 &lt; if drop 0 then</pre>
This sequence is easily replaced with:
<pre>dup 0 &gt;= *</pre>
And if fact, I now realize, even more tersely:
<pre>0 max</pre>
</p>
<p>
The only user of VARIABLE, @, ! were the two variations of the red ball.
At a small performance penalty, this:
<pre>variable xx x 0.5 - xx ! ... xx @</pre>
was replaced with:
<pre>: xx x 0.5 - ; ... xx</pre>
Fewer total words, and less 'line noise'.
</p>
<p>
Despite my 'ambitions', the words ELSE, HERE, ALLOT were never used.
They were also dropped.
</p>
<p>
As a result of dropping these words, the effort involved in adding
an optimize pass which eliminates the internal use of the dstack + rstack
arrays in favor of temporary variables was greatly reduced.
This optimization noticeably speeds up Android performance,
and is a hearty step towards being able to add WebGL support,
and thereby animation via a 't' word.
