While early prototype based languages like Self
and NewtonScript allowed multiple-prototypes, Javascript only allows
a single prototype per object. I'll explore the trade-offs
of each approach, rant vaguely.
</p>

<hr/>
<p>
Prototype based languages use a variation on object oriented programming.
Rather than use an inheritance hierarchy of classes,
prototype based languages use the notion that an object can express
just what makes it unique and then reference one or more "prototypes".
These prototypes are just other objects.
Give or take issues around initialization and mutation,
a conventional class hierarchy can be approximated by expressing classes
as prototypes themselves in a hierarchy, referenced by each instance.
However, part of the appeal of the approach is that it is ideally more
flexible than a traditional static class hierarchy, allowing for
possibilities like "dynamic inheritance".
</p>
<p>
The original prototype based language (and probably its most pure form
of expression) is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)">
Self programming language</a>.
Everything in Self, down to activation frames for parameter passing
is a collection of key value pairs in which special keys (marked with
an asterisk *) are prototypes, which can be assigned a precedence.
All parent trees are traversed when deciding how to resolve a key,
if two equal precedence resolutions are possible, an error is thrown.
This allows for multiple inheritance, with semi-sane conflict resolution.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonScript">NewtonScript</a>,
the programming language for the Apple Newton,
was inspired by a desire to fit Self into the constraints of a 128KB
device. Self like chaining was viewed as a way to compress the size
of objects as well as a flexible implementation choice.
One simplification made, was that rather than allowing an unlimited
number of prototypes, two are allowed: _proto, _parent.
_proto has a higher precedence than _parent. This allowed for _proto
to fill a traditional inheritance role, and _parent to allow GUI widgets
to propagate un-handled events up to their parent.
Unlike Self, this would not allow direct simulation of multiple
inheritance. Offhand it seems like the weaker notion of a set of
standalone mix-ins might be possible, by creating a chain of mix-ins
using _proto and _parent to build list chains, much like (car, cdr) to cons'es in Lisp. Strictly this could probably also approximate multiple
inheritance generally, with the requirement that parent classes would
have to have a strict precedence order.
</p>
<p>
Javascript in turn allows only a single prototype for each object.
An object o has o.__proto__ which its runtime prototype.
This is in turn a reference to whatever was in some Function.prototype
when new was called. Raw data objects {data: 1} are prototype-less.
This has the advantage of simplicity, but requires copying of methods
to simulate multiple inheritance.
</p>
<p>
One appeal of the Javascript approach is that while it requires a decent
amount of careful upfront copying, it can do most multiple inheritance like
behavior that a static class hierarchy would allow. Dynamic inheritance
is probably playing with fire.
The unappealing downside is that the object prototype hierarchy doesn't
reflect programmer intention, but rather the result of copying methods
as needed.
This is less of an issue in Javascript than it would be in Self, where
objects are dynamically edited and the world pickled to a system image.
</p>
<p>
The Self rules for resolving conflicts seem baroque
and arbitrary. NewtonScript allows something as flexible, if you are
willing to replace n-fanout with multiple 2-fanout branches.
Javascript requires copying, but is the simplest.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if anyone has done a prototyping language which handles
the prototype by calling an un-handled message slot with messages
to delegate. Yea old Internet says Squeak Smalltalk can do this
via ObjectTracer, but that sounds like a slow debugging type interface
not something you'd want every message to pass through.
I would imagine Self's "implicit" delegation was probably motivated
by the many performance optimizations it can do, pointing to the same
conclusion.
